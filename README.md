## üìå Project Description
I built this project to automate a simple shopping flow on **Amazon.in** . 

The flow includes:
- Logging in (manual CAPTCHA/OTP on first run, then cookies to skip login)  
- Searching for a product  
- Adding the product to cart  
- Going to checkout (but stopping before payment to avoid placing a real order)  

This helped me practice Selenium with Python, use Page Object Model for cleaner code, and learn how to save cookies for reuse.
